## Introduction

This small but efficient project allows for the charging of five 18650 lithium-ion cells simultaneously. The system uses five TP4056 Li-Ion charging modules, powered by a 12V SMPS (Switched Mode Power Supply) providing 5A. This charger is capable of handling a maximum charging current of 1A per cell.

### Components Information

#### 1. **12V/5A SMPS**
<p align = "center">
<img width="996" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-04 at 3 04 19 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c27f66fe-6ad6-4bca-ad60-23b012f579d0">
</p>
This is used to supply 60W of power. It provides better protection compared to a traditional charger. It converts the AC input to 12V DC output, suitable for powering the entire system.

#### 2. **Li-ion Charging Module (TP4056)**
<p align = "center">
  <img width="340" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-04 at 3 06 06 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45154ede-0316-4c03-b1f4-74bfdcf01d08">
</p>
The TP4056 module is a complete constant current-voltage linear charging module for single-cell 3.7V lithium batteries. It protects against overcharging and undercharging and indicates charging status with a red LED (charging) and blue LED (charging complete). Each module can handle up to 1A of charging current.

**Specifications:**
- Input voltage: 4.5V – 5.5V
- Full charge voltage: 4.25V
- Charging indication: Red LED
- Charging complete indication: Blue LED

#### 3. **Customized Board**

</p>
Cell holders make it easy to insert or remove the 18650 cells for replacement or maintenance.

#### 7. **PVC Box**
Used to house all components securely.

## Procedure

### 1. Prepare the PVC box
- Drill holes for the switch and 2-pin AC power socket.

### 2. Wiring the Power Supply
- Connect the 220V AC input from the AC power cable to the SMPS, ensuring proper wiring for safety.
  
### 3. Connect the Circuit
- Connect the power from the SMPS to the customized board, which will then distribute power to the TP4056 modules.

### 4. Install the Circuit in the PVC Box
- Place the connected circuit into the PVC box and ensure that the heat sink has enough ventilation for heat dissipation.

### 5. Connect the TP4056 Modules
- Use cell holders for connecting the TP4056 charging modules to the 18650 cells. Ensure correct polarity.

### 6. Testing the Circuit
- Power up the system by plugging in the 220V AC and verify that the red LEDs on the TP4056 modules are glowing (indicating charging).
- Check the connections to ensure everything is working properly.
